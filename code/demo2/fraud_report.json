    "ai_summary": "Document appears to be a scanned bank balance certificate with standard redactions. I observed one clear concern: the page text explicitly states the output is computer-generated and not required to be signed, yet a round bank stamp and a handwritten signature are present. I did NOT find high-confidence technical tampering indicators (no obvious clone/paste artifacts, no repeated pixel blocks, and no clear compression inconsistencies) around the stamp, signature, or numeric table. Because only one high-confidence indicator is present and other checks are negative/ambiguous, I assess overall severity as LOW. There is some uncertainty because a physical stamp/signature could have been legitimately applied before scanning; if higher-resolution originals are available further forensic checks (pixel-level compression analysis, EXIF/scan-source comparison) are recommended.",
