The low ELA and copy-move scores argue against pixel-level tampering (copy/paste), so the most likely explanations are either column/label misplacement, a formatting/printing error, or manual numeric/content modification.

    "ai_summary": "Document shows no clear signs of local image splicing or copy-move manipulation: ELA and copy-move scores are very low and visual inspection finds uniform compression and no duplicated texture blocks. Typical redaction blocks and scanning artefacts (including a circular blue bank stamp and a large diagonal halftone watermark) are present and appear visually consistent with scanning/printing. A mobile-scanner footer watermark \"Scanned by CamScanner\" is present; per the provided heuristics the presence of a mobile-scan watermark raises suspicion because it indicates the file was re-scanned through a phone app (possible non-original reproduction or post-processing). Numeric totals and line-item reconciliation could not be confidently validated from the noisy OCR, so any sum/date mismatch is inconclusive.",

There is an apparent per-line/table ending balance (~25,423,952.36 CR) visible near the bottom that differs from the summary closing balance (42,839,778.43) in the account summary; however the summary closing balance arithmetically matches Opening + Credits - Debits in the header, and the page is labeled \"Page 1 of 5,\" so the lower table line likely reflects an intermediate/page-level running balance rather than a definitive inconsistency.
